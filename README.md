# Semester 4

## Einf√ºhrung in Datenbanken
Focuses on the concept of data banks and also the query language SQL.
## Theorie der Programmierung
Focuses on functional programming and the theory behind it
## Mathe C4
Mathe C4 handles mainly on statistics and stochastics. Although not generally focused on programming, some calculations are done with python and numpy to make life easier.
## Algorithmik kontinuierlicher Systeme
### Blatt 1
General introduction to Numpy and some exemplary functions to implement from Linear Algebra, like Composition, creating an antidiagonal matrix, calculating the Kronecker-Matrix Product

### Blatt 3
This exercise focuses on solving linear systems using either LU or QR Decomposition.
- LU Decomposition uses Pivot-Elements to calculate the P, L and R Matrices.
- QR Decomposition uses Givens-Rotation to solve the system and calculate the Q and R Matrices.

### Blatt 5
This exercise is to practice Quantization and Downsampling. Median Cut Algorithm and k-Means Clustering are used to quantize a given image.

imgutils.py also includes some functions that are used in both methods.

## WebDev
Because uni doesn't even mention web development, I wanted to learn the fundamentals of it on my own. I used TypeScript, CSS, and HTML to build some small websites, which helped me get an idea how to practically build a website. Just for fun and meant for educational purposes...
